#### Introduction
\
Foetal delivery with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) can be a sign of normal foetal gastrointestinal maturation, 
though it may also indicate foetal compromise resulting in poor outcomes for the neonate. Identifying high-risk groups 
could help with resource allocation, preparation, and education. To analyze the association between black ethnicity and 
MSAF, a cross sectional study was conducted, collecting healthcare records from 16,490 labouring mothers in urban areas of 
Western Europe during the early 2000’s by attending midwives which included data on other potential confounders

#### Methods
\
Pearson’s chi-squared test was utilized to calculate crude association p-values between all variables and MSAF as well as to 
calculate any association between the primary exposure and the remaining independent variables. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) 
and 95% confidence intervals (c.i.) were calculated with Mantel–Haenszel (MH) tests for each variable to the outcome 
independently. Spearman test of correlation was used to assess multicollinearity.\
Effect modification was assessed by comparing logistic model fit with and without an interaction factor between ethnicity 
and each variable independently via likelihood ratio tests (LRTs). Variables with significant interaction were then tested 
against models with only ethnicity to assess model fit and significance of the interaction terms. \
A test for trend was conducted for non-binary variables to assess inter-stratum estimate variation, assuming linear trend 
as the null hypothesis. 
Individually adjusted ORs and 95% c.i.s were calculated for each variable that was significantly associated to the outcome 
and primary exposure, or that significantly modified the exposure with logistic regressions (LRs). 
The final LR model fit the significant confounders and effect modifiers, and stratified results via linear combinations of 
parameters (lincom) are reported

#### Conclusions
\
The final logistic model indicates that black women are 0.94 (c.i. 0.80 to 1.10) times as likely with an insignificant 
association between ethnicity and MSAF (p = 0.421).
